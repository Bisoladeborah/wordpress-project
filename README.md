Engage further by supporting the movement through the strategically placed button, linking directly to an interest form page.

By collaborating closely with a UI/UX designer, I translated their meticulously crafted wireframes into a dynamic and functional website that not only met but exceeded the client's expectations. This collaborative effort involved detailed discussions, feedback iterations, and seamless integration of design elements into the development process. Working hand-in-hand with the UI/UX designer ensured that the final product not only adhered to the technical specifications but also aligned seamlessly with the client's vision and requirements.

Customization and Design:

I utilized CSS to enhance the aesthetic appeal and ensure a cohesive design in line with the client's specifications. By implementing customized styles, I crafted a visually engaging website that precisely met the client's unique requirements.

Technology Used:

I employed a combination of tools, including the WP Form plugin, Post Grid plugin, testimonial slider plugin and Elementor header and footer plugin.

User Interaction:

I implemented a newsletter subscription form for users to receive informative tips from Cohig. Additionally, I designed a 'Support Our Initiative' interest form, encouraging users to share their details for personalized outreach. To further enhance interaction, future considerations include incorporating live chat features and interactive elements for a more dynamic user experience.

Responsiveness:

Ensuring optimal user experience across devices, I meticulously tested and optimized the website for desktops, and smartphones. By employing responsive design principles, I aimed to guarantee seamless navigation and visual appeal regardless of the device, enhancing accessibility for a broader audience.
